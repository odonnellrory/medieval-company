# Game Design Document: 3D First-Person Roguelite

## 1. Game Overview
### 1.1 Concept
A 3D first-person roguelite game inspired by Lethal Company, featuring a village hub, explorable levels, and challenging dungeons.
The gameplay loop is inspired by lethal company in that there will be 3 basic stages, 1 the village, 2 level, 3 the dungeon. The village will act as a hub for the player, having upgradeable buildings such as a blacksmith and an apothacary for potions, there will also be a plot for a player owned house which they can customise using rewards earned through the game. Progress on the village is continuous with permanent upgrades, hence the game is a rogue lite. The level will be accessed from a carriage in the village, this carriage will be present in the level and will act as a storage space for loot from the dungeon and also hold your weapons and armour you bring over from the village. Take for example one level would be a forest, and when the player arrives in this forest they will have to find the dungeon which could be a cave. When the player goes into this dungeon they will be faced with enemies like skeletons, wolves, spiders, or goblins that will guard treasure hidden throughout the dungeon. The dungeon may also contain various traps. The player must find the treasure and take it back to the carriage outside of the dungeon on the level area whilst avoiding being attacked. If a player dies inside the dungeon or in the level area they will lose all of their items permanently and all loot on the carriage. If however the player manages to get back to the carriage safely with loot they can ask the carriage driver to take them back to the village, where they can sell the loot to buy more upgrades.
